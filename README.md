In this Project, we will analyze 19 years of Indian agriculture data to find various parameters of crop production, prediction based on past data and Minimum support price for the given crop for the given year. The Project will give you a great learning experience. Letâ€™s start to know more about the project.

It also gave information about different seasonal crops at district level and area of cultivation along with total crop production.India being agriculture rich country, this data will have lots of minor and major facts which will help in charting a next successful agriculture revolution after 1965. Few facts of green revolution of India taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution_in_India: "Under premiership of Congress leader Lal Bahadur Shastri, the Green Revolution within India commenced in 1965 that led to an increase in food grain production, especially in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh"

Doing an exploratory data analysis of this dataset would give insights into Indian agriculture status: state-wise, district-wise, crop-wise, area-wise and levels of productions. A complete analysis will paint a beautiful story of this important aspect of India.

Using some tricks and tips from "Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](zerotopandas.com)" will apply to this rich and diverse dataset to glean important and broad aspects which showcase our agriculture might and how it is natured and enhanced by scientific knowledge combined with traditional cultivation process.
